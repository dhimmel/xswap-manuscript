## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Important tasks in biomedical discovery, such as repurposing drugs or predicting the function of genes and their association to disease, are often framed as network edge prediction problems.
The number of edges that each node has, termed degree, varies drastically across nodes in real world networks.
Since degree strongly influences edge prediction, any imbalance or bias in the distribution of degrees leads to nonspecific or misleading predictions.
We introduce a framework to quantify the effect of node degree on edge prediction.
Using degree-preserving network permutations, we define an "edge prior" to quantify the probability that two nodes are connected based only on their degree.
Applying the edge prior to 20 different biomedical networks (16 bipartite, 3 undirected, 1 directed),
we demonstrate that node degree information alone is capable of remarkable performance, with AUROCs frequently exceeding 85%.
The predictive performance of degree diminishes on testing networks that were generated using distinct methods and hence show little degree correlation with the training network.
Accordingly, we suggest using the edge prior as baseline for edge prediction tasks.
Performance exceeding the baseline is attributable to factors other than degree alone and is often only a small portion of overall performance.
We provide an open source Python package, named [`xswap`](https://github.com/hetio/xswap) after the permutation algorithm, that allows users to permute their own networks and compute edge priors.
Our implementation includes an analytic approximation of the edge prior for efficiency and provides a high-level API to accomodate a variety of network and edge types.
